# Data Mining and Business Analytics

### About Project
Build predictive models to help businesses achieve their sustainability goals. The rationale is to learn how the activities of a company, such as their carbon emissions, recycling rates, etc., influences their likelihood of achieving sustainability goals, so that recommendations can be generated through interpreting the predictive models.

### Technical Stuff
Jupyter Notebook:
- Research on Corperate Sustainability + Info related and applicable to project
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data/Features Engineering with Research and External data sources (To get bonus mark)
- Perform EDA

SAS EM Miner:
- Features Selection
- Data Modelling
- Model Comparison
- Model Interpretation

### About files:
- 2202934B_Data Cleaning.ipynb - jupyter notebook used for data cleaning and preparation.
- Normalize data - Normalize all numerical features using z-score scaling because doing so manually in SAS EM is torture.
- Min-max data - Normalize all numerical features using z-score scaling because of Polynomial interpretability.
- 2202934_DMBA.zip - SAS EM Miner file, zipped.
- P03_Javen Lai Le Yu.pdf - Report.
